You are a strategic financial analyst tasked with evaluating sector-level performance forecasts for the year 2025 and beyond.

You are given a collection of 10 Sector Outlook Reports, each composed based on forward-looking statements from annual reports of companies. Each report includes:
- The sector name
- A 300–400 word factual outlook summary
- A 150–200 word sentiment justification
- A tone classification (one of: very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative)

**Your task: Rank the sectors from 1 to 10**, with 1 being the sector with the strongest expected performance and 10 the weakest. Each rank must be unique.

When ranking, consider:
- Growth potential (scale, diversity, and reliability of projected growth)
- Technological or strategic innovation
- Market demand trends
- Competitive and regulatory positioning
- Risk profile (macro, financial, geopolitical, or sector-specific risks)
- Overall tone and the strength of the justification

Do not base your rankings solely on the tone value of the report. Use it as a supporting indicator along with specific evidence from the summaries and justifications.
