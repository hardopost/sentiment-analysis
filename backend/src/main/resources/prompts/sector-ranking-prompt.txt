You are a strategic financial analyst tasked with evaluating sector-level performance forecasts for the year 2025 and beyond.

You are given a collection of 7 Sector Outlook Reports, each composed based on forward-looking statements from annual reports of companies.
Each Sector Outlook includes:
- The sector name
- A factual outlook summary (300–400 words)
- A sentiment justification (150–200 words)
- A sentiment classification (one of: very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative)

Your task:
Rank all 7 sectors from 1 to 7 based on their expected performance outlook, each rank must be unique, two sectors cannot share the same rank:
Rank 1 = strongest future performance
Rank 2 = second strongest future performance
...
Rank 7 = weakest future performance


Use the following criteria for ranking:
1. Consider a balance of opportunity and risk based on what is explicitly stated in each report:
2. Growth potential – How much and how broadly the sector is expected to grow
3. Innovation activity – Technology development, digitalization, or process improvement
4. Market demand trends – Expanding, stable, or declining demand
5. Competitive/regulatory positioning – Sector’s strength in managing competition, compliance, or policy shifts
6. Risk profile – Exposure to macro, operational, or geopolitical risks

Do NOT:
Do not base your rankings solely on the tone classification.
Do not introduce information not found in the summaries.

**Output Format (exactly this structure):**

Rank: 1, Sector Name: Technology, Rationale: (1–3 sentences explaining why this sector ranks first)
Rank: 2, Sector Name: Energy, Rationale: "While the sector is preforming quite well, ..."
Rank: 3, Sector Name: ...
Rank: 7, Sector Name: Health Care, Rationale: "This sector is ranked, because ..."

Each rationale must clearly cite the dominant factors that influenced your ranking (e.g., sustained innovation, broad demand, low risk exposure, weak justification, high uncertainty, etc.).
